# Tic-Tac-Go

This is a simple command line Tic-tac-toe game I wrote to explore Golang. To play the game, install Golang, set the GOPATH to this repo and run

```go build game.go```

This will produce a binary executable called ```game``` that can be run.

There are two players, X and O. By default, player X goes first. Take turns with the keyboard starting with player X. 

To move around on the grid, use the arrow keys.<br />
To take a turn on a spot, navigate to the spot and hit enter.<br />
To quit, press Control-C
